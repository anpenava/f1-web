title: Wildcard
content:
  "<p>The Wildcard allows you to make up to 12 substitutions for free in the raceweek you play it, enabling you to make a full team reset and to make additional substitutions to grow your budget. You get two Wildcard plays per season - one in the first half of the season up to the summer break at Hungary and one after the summer break from Belgium onwards for the second half of the season. Each Wildcard play is valid for one raceweek and is automatically removed from your team after it has been played. If you do not use your first Wildcard play before the summer break it will not be carried forward after the break. Once your Wildcards are played you cannot use them again for the rest of the season</p>"
