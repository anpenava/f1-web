title: Points Scoring
content:
  "
    <p>Your drivers and constructors score points based on their performance in qualifying and race each raceweek. All 5 drivers and 1 constructor score points each raceweek, in line with the <a href=''/points-scoring'' target=''points-scoring'' class=''web__link''>Points Scoring table.</a></p>
    <p>Constructors score all points accumulated by their drivers apart from \"driver only\" scoring categories (\"beat team mate\" bonuses and \"driver streak\" bonuses). The relevant driver totals (excluding driver only categories) are combined to give the constructor points total - for example: Mercedes = Hamilton + Bottas scores.</p>
    <p>Positions gained are based on the position the driver starts at on the grid as this may differ from where they finished in qualifying.</p>
