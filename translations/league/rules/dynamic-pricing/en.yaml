title: Dynamic Pricing
content: 
  "
    <p>Prices change continuously based on performance and on users making team substitutions. You can use your Subs Bank to grow your budget above $100m by adding and removing drivers and constructors from your team each raceweek, giving you more to spend on other drivers and constructors as the season progresses.</p>
    <p>As prices may change frequently, it is the price of a newly added driver or constructor at the time you save your team that will be applied, even if that price is slightly different from the price you saw on screen when you were originally selecting the driver or constructor.</p>
