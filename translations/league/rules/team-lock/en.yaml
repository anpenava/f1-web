title: Team Lock
content: "<p>At the start of qualifying each raceweek all teams are locked and no more substitutions can be made for that raceweek. Once the team lock happens, all fantasy teams for that raceweek become visible for all users to see in the league leaderboards. The next raceweek is also opened at the team lock time so you can continue to add and remove drivers and constructors from your teams and increase your available budget for the following raceweek.</p>"
