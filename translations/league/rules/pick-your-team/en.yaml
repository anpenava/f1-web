title: Teams
content:
  "<p>You can pick up to three F1 Fantasy teams to manage throughout the season, each having 5 drivers and 1 constructor from an initial $100m budget. There are no restrictions on how many drivers you can pick from any one Formula 1 team. Your teams will score points based on your selected team members'' performance in Grands Prix during the 2021 season - all 5 drivers and 1 constructor score points each raceweek.</p>
  <p>You can make as many changes to your team as you wish before the season starts. It is the last saved version of your team each week that gets entered into all the leagues you have joined.</p>
  <p>Initially you have a budget of $100m to spend on your drivers and constructor. As your drivers and constructor increase or decrease in price throughout the season, these price changes get reflected in your total value, which is the sum of your team value and your remaining budget. If one of your drivers goes up in value, you can lock in that price increase by removing him from your team so you have more budget available to spend on other drivers. As such, your available budget and the available budgets of other players in F1 Fantasy may be greater than or less than $100m as the season progresses.</p>"
