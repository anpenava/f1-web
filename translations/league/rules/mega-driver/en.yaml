      Mega Driver is a booster that multiplies the points scored by the selected driver by 3x. Apart from your Turbo Driver, any driver in your team can be selected as your Mega Driver – no price restrictions apply for the Mega Driver.

      You get two Mega Driver plays per season – one in the first half of the season up to the summer break at Hungary and one after the summer break from Belgium onwards for the second half of the season. Each Mega Driver play is valid for one raceweek and is automatically removed from your team after it has been played. If you do not user your first Mega Driver play before the summer break it will not be carried forward after the break. Once your Mega Driver plays are used, you cannot use them again for the rest of the season.

      If your Mega Driver finishes with negative points, his negative score will be tripled: -3 points will become -9 points.
