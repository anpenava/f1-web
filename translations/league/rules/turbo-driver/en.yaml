title: Turbo Driver
content:
  "<p> You must select one driver per team to be your Turbo Driver each raceweek - this player will score 2x points.</p>
  <p>Your Turbo Driver can be a different driver each raceweek but must cost less than $20m and must be selected prior to saving your team. You can change your Turbo Driver each raceweek without penalty as Turbo Driver changes do not count as a substitution. If your Turbo Driver''s price increases to $20m or above after you have selected him as your Turbo Driver, he will remain your Turbo Driver for the current raceweek and will score 2x points. However at the start of the next raceweek, if your Turbo Driver is still priced at $20m or above, the Turbo Driver will be automatically changed to the next highest priced driver in your team priced below $20m.</p>
  <p>If your Turbo Driver finishes with negative points, his negative score will be doubled: -2 points will become -4 points.</p>"
