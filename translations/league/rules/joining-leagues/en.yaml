title: Joining Leagues
content: "<p>Leagues enable groups of people to enter their F1 Fantasy teams against each other and compete for top position in the league leaderboard. Leagues may last from two raceweeks up to the whole season. Your team 1 is automatically entered into the Global F1 League, as well as the league of your home country and the league of your favourite constructor - only your team 1 can be entered into these leagues. You can join as many public leagues as you want in the <a href=''/leagues'' class=''web__link''>Leagues Lobby</a> (up to a maximum of 250 leagues per season). You can also create and enter private leagues with your friends - these can be single-entry (one team per user), double-entry (up to two teams per user) or triple-entry (up to three teams per user) leagues. These leagues can be private or public and can be easily joined by friends through the unique code for each league.</p>"
