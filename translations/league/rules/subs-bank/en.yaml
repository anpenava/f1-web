    <p>The Subs Bank allows you to make up to 6 substitutions to your team each raceweek before the team lock time. The first 3 substitutions each raceweek are free, with additional substitutions incurring a penalty of -10pts per substitution. Each time you save a team substitution your Subs Bank is reduced by one. You can only make as many substitutions to your team as your Subs Bank allows before the team lock time. Unused substitutions do not carry forward to the following raceweek. With prices changing continuously due to Dynamic Pricing, you can use your Subs Bank to grow your budget above $100m so as the season progresses, you can afford better drivers and constructors to score more points.</p>
