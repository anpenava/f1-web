    title: Total Value
    text: As your drivers and constructor change in price over time, this impacts <br class=''web__break''> your team’s total value. Total value is the current value of your drivers and <br class=''web__break''> constructor plus your remaining budget.

    title: Remaining Budget
    text: Everyone starts with a budget of $100m. If you add a driver to your team <br class=''web__break''> when his price is $15.0m and he is now priced at $25.0m, your Total Value <br class=''web__break''> will be $110.0m. If you then remove this driver from your team you will lock in the <br class=''web__break''> $10.0m price increase, which will be added to your remaining budget so you <br class=''web__break''> have more to spend on your next driver.
