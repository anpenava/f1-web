  title: Technical Correction
message:
  error-1: A technical issue occurred at the unlock time for the Mugello raceweek on Saturday that resulted in some Monza teams not being copied across correctly to Mugello. Your team was one of the teams affected. We have corrected the issue now and your Mugello team has been reset to your Monza team. As you added Pierre Gasly or AlphaTauri to your team before they increased in price, this substitution has been added to your team for the price they had before the increase so your team has the benefit of the increase. The substitution has been made for your originally subbed driver or your next most eligible driver. All other substitutions made to your Mugello team have had to be removed and you are free to make them again now. We apologise for the inconvenience caused by this issue.
